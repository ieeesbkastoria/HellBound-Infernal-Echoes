Please, consider that is a pre-test Level version Only. With the perpose to get me more familiar with Unity staff.
More staff will probable change and add in the future, As more ideas cames to mind of the team. 
Don't judge if you find mistakes and missunderstandings,But don't hesitate to report them either.
I would like to hear your opinion.

(That Level version include a test character also) 
In the process of the level-making I realize that I need a character to test some game fetures(and also for the troll), like traps,scripts and the finally screen.
That character perpose is only for testing. And we probably get rid of him in the future. As the new protagonist came to life.
You can try to play tho. But be mindfull that some fetures don't work as it SHOULD be. Not to mention, that player jump's for infinity.<3
